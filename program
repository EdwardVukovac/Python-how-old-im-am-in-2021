# PROBLEM SOLVING
# We need the birth year, month and day to get the age
# we need three inputs
# birth_year, birth_month, birth_day

# To get the age we need also need today year, month and day
# we need three inputs
# today_year, today_month, today_day

# And to get the age we need to subtract the date-today by the birth-date
# today_year - birth_year
# today_month - birth_month
# today_day - birth_day
# we get age_year, age_month and age_day


# Example
# Person was born on 2002/02/02 and today date is 2021/09/30
# we get the time from the user when the user was born and the date today


# the year the person was born
# Input birth year
birth_year = int(input("Birth year: "))  # 2002 year

# Input birth month
birth_month = int(input("Birth month: "))  # 2 month

# Input birth day
birth_day = int(input("Birth day: "))  # 2 day


# To get the age we need today year, month and day
# Input year
date_year = int(input("Today's year: "))  # 2021 year

# Input month
date_month = int(input("Today's month: "))  # 9 month

# Input day
date_day = int(input("Today's day: "))  # 30 day


# And to get the age
# years old
age_year = date_year - birth_year

# months old
age_month = date_month - birth_month

# days old
age_day = date_day - birth_day


print(f"You are {age_year} years {age_month} months {age_day} days old")


# we also want an error message if a non-positive integer is given

if birth_year <= 0 or birth_month <= 0 or birth_day <= 0 or date_year <= 0 or date_month <= 0 or date_day <= 0:
    print("You entered a non positive integer 0 or less, so you may get the wrong answer")


# Output:
# How old im am in 2021
# Birth year: 2002
# Birth month: 2
# Birth day: 2
# Today's year: 2021
# Today's month: 9
# Today's day 30
# You are 19 years 7 months 28 days old
